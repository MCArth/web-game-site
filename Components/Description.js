                Many of the Mine and Craft games listed here are based on the game Minecraft.
                Minecraft is a game with many players. Minecraft introduced many new game mechanics not seen before in games.
                Players loved, and still love, these game mechanics.
                <h2>
                    History of Mine and Craft games
                </h2>
                In the beginning there was Minecraft.
                But even a legendary game such as Minecraft had to come from somewhere.
                Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson is the creator of Minecraft.
                Notch was a game developer and spent his spare time making fun web games. One day, Notch came across a game called Infiniminer. This game inspired much of the Minecraft we know and love.
                The features inspired by Infiniminer include the first person mode, the blocky visual style and even the fundamental block building!
                Over time Minecraft was slowly developed into the game we know and love today.
                It&apos;s not a suprise Minecraft is so popular, both building and crafting in a single game was surely a recipe for success.

                    Why create the definitive list of top Mine and Craft games?
                </h2>
                Minecraft is a very fun game. When Minecraft was created, not many games existed where you could both Mine and Craft.
                Over time, game developers have created new Mine and Craft games.
            
                However there are many more games involving no Mining or Crafting, and it is hard to sift through the garbage to find Mine and Craft games.
                Moreover, there are Mine and Craft games that are not even fun to play! It is hard to believe, but we live in a crazy world.
                So we created this website listing the top Mine and Craft games, ranging from games like Minecraft Classic to other web classics such as voxiom.io
