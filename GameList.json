If you want to survive, you’ll have to find food and secure all of the resources you need to survive. You’re lucky, since there’s a ton of wild-life running around. It’s not always easy to hunt them down, but if you want to eat, you’ll have to try. You can also gather resources that you find on the ground. You can make tools out of them and build defenses and other structures. During the day, the surroundings are safe, but during night time, you better run hide in your hut, else feral animals might hunt you down. Enjoy this great game, where you’ll be playing on a deserted island!"

Aside from that the game is also offering many strange items, such as portals that allow you to move very quickly around the map. In the middle of the map, there is a safe zone, where you cannot be harmed. When you get out of this zone, you should be alert, since you can be attacked at any moment!"
