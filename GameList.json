        "desc": "The Island Survival is an action online game where you’ll be fighting for your life. You find yourselves alone in a small hut in the middle of nowhere. If you want to survive, you’ll have to find food and secure all of the resources you need to survive. You’re lucky, since there’s a ton of wild-life running around. It’s not always easy to hunt them down, but if you want to eat, you’ll have to try. You can also gather resources that you find on the ground. You can make tools out of them and build defenses and other structures. During the day, the surroundings are safe, but during night time, you better run hide in your hut, else feral animals might hunt you down. Enjoy this great game, where you’ll be playing on a deserted island!"

But aside from that, you can build whatever you want around yourself. You simply need to get rid of some blocks and add a few other ones. You can also dig underground and explore that way. So start playing!"
