It’s not always easy to hunt them down, but if you want to eat, you’ll have to try. You can also gather resources that you find on the ground. You can make tools out of them and build defenses and other structures. During the day, the surroundings are safe, but during night time, you better run hide in your hut, else feral animals might hunt you down.
